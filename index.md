I am a technologist and entrepreneur with a wide variety of experience.

On the founding team of AugmentCXM (Acquired by [Sutherland](https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/)) I built AI/ML productivity tools for call centers, supporting thousands of agents to improve millions of interactions. 

I also created & maintain [AdAccelerator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ad-accelerator/gpboiedfklodfhngobidfjecdpmccehg?authuser=0&hl=en) an [open source](https://github.com/rkk3/ad-accelerator) Chrome Extension with 20,000+ users and 300+ stars on Github. 

Experienced in Product Management, Full-Stack web development (Python, React, NextJs, Typescript) and Machine Learning (NLP).

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, chess (~1500), power lifting, and have been learning Chinese.
